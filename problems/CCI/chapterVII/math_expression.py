"""
Suppose you were asked to write a function to add two simple mathematical expressions which are of the form Axâ€¢ + Bxb + . . . (where the coefficients and exponents can be any positive or negative real number). That is, the expression is a sequence of terms, where each term is simply a constant times an exponent. The interviewer also adds that she doesn't want you to have to do string parsing, so you can use whatever data structure you'd like to hold the expressions.
